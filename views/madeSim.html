<h1>The Story Of Our Project</h1>
<ol class='story'>
    <li><b>Inspiration: </b>First, Sophie and Kaya decided to do something on the heart when we were in Melbourne for the robogals awards weekend 2014 with our
    <a href='http://reactiontimes.github.io/' target='_blank'>Reaction Times</a> project</li>
    
    <li><b>Idea for the Simulation: </b>Sophie then went 'Girls make Games' where I learnt about Unity,
    after that Sophie realised she could do a heart simulation</li>
    
    <li><b>A start: </b>Sophie then went to a program she had made in the previous NCSS challenge and found a program Sophie wrote in python on around particles<br>
    Then Sophie copied the code into a python code file and then converted to C# to make a unity program game from the program</li>
    
    <li><b>Improvements: </b>Sophie changed the new Unity game, adding first a box, added a third dimension, and gradually changed the game until the particles
    moved in the way blood cells would move</li>
    
    <li><b>Our Background Script and Filming: </b>Kaya then made a background script. Sophie and Kaya then went to The Museum of Heart Disease and
    filmed the background script on heart disease</li>
    
    <li><b>Blender: </b>Sophie and Kaya then created blood cells in blender, which were imported into unity to give the correct look.
    Sophie and Kaya did work on creating arteries in blender, eventually finding the artery needed to be 'uwrapped' to give the correct appearance</li>
    
    <li><b>Coding physics: </b>Then Sophie made new c# code file for the plaques, and the rest of the physics.  By adding the physics the blood
    flowed correctly just by adding more cells to the artery for each pump of the heart</li>
    
    <li><b>Coding the Plaques: </b>Sophie coded all the plaques to change between each other including having no plaque at all using the "p" key and
    the project was ready for the experiments</li>
    
    <li><b>Predictions and Movie Editing: </b>Sophie and Kaya then made predictions for the experiments, and Sophie ran and recorded experiments and submitted a
    movie for Robogals Science Challenge</li>
    
    <li><b>Awesome new changes: </b>After completing the science challenges, Sophie then made a new web server to host the project on pythonanywhere,
    added Virtual Reality by coding the virtual camera movement and Sophie also added a new camera and then added the code to make the camera switch</li>
    
    <li><b>Hooking the Oculus up: </b>Sophie then bowered the Oculus from her school and a the project with Education,
    Experiment tools and Experiments and this web site was entered into Young ICT Explorers</li>
    
    <li><b>Presenting at young ICT Explorers(state): </b>The project won a first prize in Young ICT explorers NSW.</li>
    
    <li><b>The Nationals at Young ICT Explorers: </b>The project then won third prize in the Young ICT explorers National finals</li>
    
    <li><b>First ever presentation: </b>Sophie and Kaya were asked to be presenters at an Augmented Reality Sydney Conference</li>
    
    <li><b>Robogals Weekend: </b>The science Experiment won Second Prize at Robogals Science Challenge national awards weekend</li>
    
    <li><b>ABC3 Invatation: </b>ABC3 invites Sophie and Kaya to be on a show called "This is Me"</li>
    
    <b>The Story Continues...</b>
