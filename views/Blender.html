    Imagine if there were no models it would be hard to help find a cure for
    heart disease.<br>
    But since we have these models which are like pictures (3D of course) in a book
    help us demonstrate and explain what heart disease is. They are also helpfull for our animations
    and simulations and other people would find them easy to use.
