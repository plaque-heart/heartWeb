<h1>Heart Disease: THE NUMBER ONE KILLER IN MODERN SOCIETY</h1>
<p>
    Atherosclerosis is a condition where plaque builds up in the coronary arteries. It is the number one killer in developed countries. more background to here
    we need to say how big a problem this is. Tony?
    
    <br>Our system will continue to improve and allow research experiments.

<h1>Heart Simulation Modeling: USING TECHNOLOGY TO SAVE LIVES</h1>
<p>
    This is where we say what we are doing to solve the problem.  Education, research tools and our own research.
    We chose to create the IT tools to help save lives from heart disease.<br>
    We are providing models, with animation of the heart and vessels with plaque and without. We then imported these models into Unity and created a simulation system to allow experiments on how plaque restricts blood flow, and how to restore the blood flow.
    
    We want to help research a cure for heart disease, specifically for heart disease from plaque, a  fatty, waxy substance that can build up in artery walls.
    
    There's a <a href="Simulation.html">simulation</a> .
    If you want to see our code or our project <a href="https://github.com/plaque-heart/Heart-Model">Click Here!</a>
    You can join our project on Gihub,  download and set experiment settings in the 'right' object.  Settings for sample size and timing are there already but you can add others.
    If you join as a full member you can use all the tools and help improve our tools and fluid dynamics to make better and better ways to research heart disease.
