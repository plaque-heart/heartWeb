<h1>Heart Disease: THE NUMBER ONE KILLER IN MODERN SOCIETY</h1>
<p>
    <img alt="graph" class="graph"src="static/heart-graph.png" target="_blank">
    Atherosclerosis is a condition where plaque builds up in the coronary arteries. It is the number one killer in developed countries. Someone we knew recently
     got a stent and almost half the people in the modern world over the age of 40 have some degree of heart diesease. Could that be you?
    
    <br>We are going to save lives and change those statistics for the better<br><br>

    <h3>This is how we will help solve the problem: Using virual reality tools to calculate blood flow.</h3>

            <p>
               In <a href="http://www.epi.umn.edu/cvdepi/study-synopsis/korean-soldiers-study/" target="_blank">1951, over 70% of people had heart disease(especially atherosclerosis)</a>
                and the main reason less people now get heart disease is because
                of education. Showing the blood flow using virtual realtiy gets people interested to learn,
                and by continuing with more education the percentage will go down even more!

            <h2>Research Tools</h2>
            <p>Modeling the behaviour of individual cells means we have created tools for use in experiments that would be too dangerous to try
            with living hearts.
            Our project is open source allowing others to add to these tools and use our tools.
            Research can help save lives and we help research</p>

            <h2>Our Research</h2>
            <p>We have already used our tools for experiments and have results that can help design treatments to save lives.
            We have analysed blood flow with different treatments for plaque to see which works best.</p>
