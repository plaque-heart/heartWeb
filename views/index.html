    Atherosclerosis is a condition where plaque builds up in the coronary arteries. It is the number one killer in developed countries. Someone we knew recently
     got a stent and half the people in the world over the age of 40 have some degree of heart diesease. Could that be you?
    
    <br>Our system will continue to improve and allow research experiments.

            <p>
               In 1951, over 70% of people had heart diesease(specially atherosclerosis) and the main reason that the pecentage has gone down is because
                of education. By continuing with more education the percentage will go down even more!

            <p>We have created tools for use in experiments using simulation to save testing with living hearts.
            Our project is open source allowing others to add to these tools and use our tools.  Research can help save lives and we help research</p>
