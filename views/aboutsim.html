                (actual instructions are in next section)<br>
                This is the core of the project and it is made using Unity<br>
                The simulation helps education and research and can allow others to do more research.<br>
                The technology is all about objects (classes - more in coding section)<br>

                This is the easiest way for fluid dynamics, computer does all the work by calculating physics for every cell.
                Only need to write the code once in the cell class. The program reads a file describing blood cells, and the program creates the cells each heartbeat.
                The program also calculates standard deviation and mean automatically.
